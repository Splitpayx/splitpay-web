# SplitPay

## 1. Overview

SplitPay is a collaborative payment and fund distribution platform built on Stellar.

It allows individuals, teams, agencies, freelancers, and other groups to create payment pools, define how incoming funds should be distributed, receive payments in supported Stellar assets, and distribute those funds automatically according to predefined split rules.

The system consists of:

* `splitpay-web` - primary web application
* `splitpay-contract` - Soroban smart contract responsible for on-chain pool and distribution logic
* `splitpay-mobile` - React Native mobile application
* `splitpay-sdk` - shared client SDK, introduced when the contract interface stabilizes
* `splitpay-api` - optional off-chain backend for metadata, indexing, notifications and application services

The blockchain is responsible for financial rules and settlement that require verifiability.

The application layer is responsible for UX, metadata and services that do not need to live on-chain.

# 2. Product Vision

SplitPay should allow a group of people to receive money together without requiring one person to act as the trusted middleman.

Instead of:

```text
Client
  ↓
One person's wallet
  ↓
Manual calculations
  ↓
Manual transfers
  ↓
Team members
```

SplitPay should provide:

```text
Payer
  ↓
SplitPay Pool
  ↓
Soroban Contract
  ↓
┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
Member A   Member B   Member C
```

The contract enforces the distribution rules.

---

# 3. Core Concepts

## Pool

A Pool is an on-chain collaborative payment configuration.

A pool contains:

* unique pool identifier
* owner
* members
* supported asset
* split configuration
* status
* creation timestamp
* optional metadata reference

A pool does not represent a bank account.

It represents rules for how funds should be distributed.

## Member

A member is an address participating in a pool.

Each member has a percentage share.

Example:

```text
Alice    50%
Bob      30%
Charlie  20%
```

The total must always equal exactly 100%.

## Payment

A Payment represents funds deposited into a pool for distribution.

A payment contains:

* payment identifier
* pool identifier
* payer
* asset
* gross amount
* split snapshot
* timestamp

The split configuration used for a payment must be immutable after the payment is created.

## Distribution

A Distribution represents the amounts assigned to individual members from a payment.

Example:

```text
Payment: 100 USDC

Alice    50 USDC
Bob      30 USDC
Charlie  20 USDC
```

---

# 4. Blockchain Responsibility

The Soroban contract is the source of truth for:

* pool creation
* pool membership
* split configuration
* split validation
* supported asset configuration
* payment settlement
* distribution calculations
* payment split snapshots
* authorization
* on-chain events
* relevant financial state

The contract must not depend on the web application to enforce financial rules.

The web application is a client of the contract.

---

# 5. Web Responsibility

`splitpay-web` is responsible for:

* authentication/onboarding
* wallet connection
* pool discovery
* pool management UI
* member management UI
* split configuration UI
* payment creation UI
* transaction status
* transaction history
* portfolio/balance presentation
* notifications
* application metadata

The web application must never be treated as the authoritative source for financial balances or split calculations.

---

# 6. Mobile Responsibility

`splitpay-mobile` will provide the same core functionality through React Native.

It should consume the same contract interface and eventually use the same SDK as the web application.

Business rules must not be duplicated between web and mobile.

---

# 7. Contract Architecture

The initial contract should be a single SplitPay protocol contract.

It should interact with Stellar assets through the Stellar Asset Contract / SEP-41 token interface.

Conceptually:

```text
User
 │
 │ authorize
 ▼
SplitPay Contract
 │
 │ token transfer
 ▼
Stellar Asset Contract
 │
 ▼
Recipient Accounts
```

The SplitPay contract is not a token contract.

It is a payment splitting and distribution contract.

---

# 8. Initial Contract Interface

The initial contract should expose functionality conceptually equivalent to:

```text
initialize(admin)

create_pool(pool_id, owner, asset)

add_member(pool_id, member, share)

remove_member(pool_id, member)

update_member_share(pool_id, member, share)

set_pool_status(pool_id, status)

get_pool(pool_id)

get_member(pool_id, member)

get_pool_members(pool_id)

create_payment(payment_id, pool_id, payer, amount)

settle_payment(payment_id)

get_payment(payment_id)

get_distribution(payment_id, member)
```

The exact interface may change during implementation if Soroban conventions or security considerations require it.

---

# 9. Pool Lifecycle

```text
CREATE
  ↓
CONFIGURE
  ↓
ACTIVE
  ↓
PAYMENT
  ↓
SETTLED
  ↓
COMPLETED
```

A pool should not accept payments until its configuration is valid.

A pool's split percentages must always equal:

```text
10000 basis points
```

Therefore:

```text
50% = 5000
25% = 2500
25% = 2500

Total = 10000
```

Basis points should be preferred over floating point percentages.

---

# 10. Payment Lifecycle

```text
Payment Created
      ↓
Validate Pool
      ↓
Validate Asset
      ↓
Validate Amount
      ↓
Validate Pool Configuration
      ↓
Snapshot Split
      ↓
Transfer Asset
      ↓
Calculate Distribution
      ↓
Transfer Allocations
      ↓
Emit Events
      ↓
Payment Settled
```

Settlement must be atomic.

If any required operation fails, the entire transaction should revert.

---

# 11. Split Calculation

For a payment amount `A` and member share `S`:

```text
member_amount = A × S / 10000
```

All calculations must use integer arithmetic.

No floating point arithmetic is allowed in the contract.

The implementation must define how remainder units are handled.

The preferred invariant is:

```text
sum(member allocations) == payment amount
```

No funds may disappear because of rounding.

For the first implementation, the contract should reject configurations where deterministic allocation cannot satisfy the exact total, or use a clearly documented remainder policy.

---

# 12. Payment Snapshot

When a payment is settled, the contract must snapshot the active split configuration.

Example:

```text
Pool:

Alice 60%
Bob   40%

Payment #1
→ Alice 60
→ Bob 40
```

If the pool later changes to:

```text
Alice 70%
Bob   30%
```

Payment #1 must remain:

```text
Alice 60
Bob   40
```

Historical payments must never be recalculated using current pool configuration.

---

# 13. Authorization

Contract functions must enforce authorization based on the actor responsible for the operation.

Examples:

* pool owner authorizes pool configuration changes
* member authorizes actions requiring member authority
* payer authorizes payment funding
* administrative functions require contract administrator authorization where applicable

Never trust an address passed as an argument without verifying authorization.

---

# 14. Assets

The contract should support Stellar assets through the Stellar Asset Contract interface.

The first supported assets should be:

* XLM
* Stellar test assets during development
* USDC on the target network when appropriate

The contract should not hard-code a specific issuer unless explicitly required.

Asset addresses must be treated as configuration.

---

# 15. Events

Important state changes should emit structured events.

Initial events should include:

```text
pool_created
member_added
member_removed
share_updated
pool_status_changed
payment_created
payment_settled
distribution_created
```

Events should contain enough information for an indexer or frontend to reconstruct activity without relying exclusively on contract storage.

---

# 16. Storage

Use Soroban storage deliberately.

Expected storage categories include:

```text
Pool
Member
Payment
Distribution
Configuration
```

Large collections should not be stored inefficiently in a single growing object.

Storage design must consider:

* ledger footprint
* TTL
* archival/restoration
* read frequency
* write frequency
* scalability

State archival and TTL management should be considered before production deployment.

---

# 17. Security Requirements

The contract must:

* validate all input
* reject zero or negative payment amounts
* reject invalid shares
* enforce 100% split configuration
* enforce authorization
* prevent unauthorized pool modifications
* prevent duplicate payment identifiers
* prevent double settlement
* validate pool status
* validate supported assets
* use checked integer arithmetic
* prevent rounding loss
* ensure atomic settlement
* avoid reentrancy assumptions where cross-contract calls are involved
* emit deterministic events
* have comprehensive tests

Financial invariants take priority over convenience.

---

# 18. Important Invariants

These invariants must always hold.

### Split invariant

```text
sum(all member shares) == 10000
```

### Payment invariant

```text
payment amount > 0
```

### Distribution invariant

```text
sum(all distributions) == payment amount
```

### Settlement invariant

```text
payment cannot be settled twice
```

### Authorization invariant

```text
only authorized actors can mutate protected state
```

### Snapshot invariant

```text
historical payment distributions never change
```

---

# 19. Off-Chain Data

The following should generally remain off-chain:

* user profiles
* display names
* avatars
* descriptions
* project documents
* email notifications
* application preferences
* analytics
* search indexes
* rich metadata

The blockchain should not become the application's general-purpose database.

---

# 20. API / Indexing Layer

An optional backend can provide:

```text
Transaction indexing
Notification delivery
Metadata storage
Search
Analytics
Webhook processing
Application-specific APIs
```

It must derive financial truth from Stellar and the contract, not invent its own balances.

---

# 21. Repository Structure

The organization should eventually contain:

```text
splitpay-web
splitpay-contract
splitpay-mobile
splitpay-sdk
splitpay-api
splitpay-docs
```

Initial development focuses on:

```text
splitpay-contract
splitpay-web
splitpay-mobile
```

---

# 22. Development Networks

Development should begin on Stellar Testnet.

No production/mainnet assumptions should be hard-coded.

Configuration must allow network-specific:

* RPC endpoint
* network passphrase
* contract address
* asset addresses
* deployment account
* explorer URLs

---

# 23. Contract Development Stack

The contract uses:

```text
Rust
Soroban SDK
Stellar CLI
Cargo
WASM
Stellar Testnet
```

Testing should use Soroban's local test environment before Testnet integration.

---

# 24. Testing Strategy

Contract testing must include:

### Unit tests

* pool creation
* member management
* share validation
* payment creation
* distribution calculation
* authorization
* duplicate payments
* invalid states

### Financial invariant tests

* total shares always equal 100%
* distributions equal payment amount
* no rounding loss
* no double settlement

### Integration tests

* contract + Stellar asset
* payment settlement
* multiple members
* multiple payments
* changed splits between payments

### Failure tests

Every expected failure condition should be explicitly tested.

---

# 25. Non-Goals

The first version should NOT attempt to build:

* a custom SplitPay token
* a decentralized exchange
* lending
* yield generation
* cross-chain bridges
* fiat custody
* a complete banking system
* arbitrary smart contract execution
* complex DAO governance

The protocol should stay focused on collaborative payment splitting.

---

# 26. Future Features

Potential future additions:

* recurring payments
* milestone payments
* payment links
* invoices
* dispute workflows
* escrow-style release
* multi-asset pools
* scheduled distributions
* team permissions
* DAO/team treasury functionality
* fiat on/off-ramp integrations
* Stellar anchor integrations
* mobile wallet features
* advanced analytics

These are not part of the initial contract scope.

---

# 27. Guiding Principle

SplitPay should not put everything on-chain.

It should put the **financial rules that must be trusted** on-chain and keep everything else where it is cheaper, faster and easier to maintain.

The contract is the financial source of truth.

The web and mobile applications are clients.

The backend is an optional service layer.

The SDK is the shared interface between applications and the protocol.
